# Splunk SIEM: Setup and Incident Investigation

Built and configured a virtual Splunk lab environment with multiple vulnerable machines to simulate security monitoring in a SIEM platform. The project included log collection from both Windows and Linux systems, creation of alerts, and in-depth incident analysis of simulated cyber attacks on vulnerable servers. Investigated activities such as reconnaissance, exploitation, initial access, and privilege escalation.
